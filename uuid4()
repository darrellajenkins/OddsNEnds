"""uuid.uuid4() = Generates a random UUID.
The uuid4() function in Python's uuid module generates a new, unique 32-digit hexadecimal 
number every time it is called, regardless of the computer or system it's running on.

The uuid4() function generates a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) version 4, which is based on random numbers.
The algorithm used to generate these UUIDs is designed to ensure that the probability of generating duplicate UUIDs
is extremely low, even across different computers and systems. To put this into perspective, if you were to generate
a billion UUIDs per second, it would take approximately 1.0787e+21 years (over a quintillion years) to have a 50%
probability of generating a duplicate UUID. This extremely large number of possible combinations is one of the reasons
why UUIDs generated by uuid4() are considered highly unlikely to have collisions or duplicates, even across different systems
and over a long period of time."""

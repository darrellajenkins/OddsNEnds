# How to convert a text file into a csv file and also remove and/or replace unwanted characters:

import pandas

with open("quotes.txt") as file:
    start = file.readlines()
    for row in start:
        if "~" in row:
            b = row
            c = b.replace("~", ",")
            with open("quotes2.txt", mode="a") as newfile:
                newfile.write(c)

with open("quotes2.txt") as file5:
    onefile = file5.readlines()

dataset = pandas.DataFrame(onefile)

dataset.to_csv("quotes2.csv")
